## 1) Project background

This analysis is based on a fictional data, but with real background and situation.

Flyball is a relay team competition for dogs where participants jump obstacles to retrieve a ball from a special box. The competitions are run in teams of four dogs, as a relay. If you want to know more information about the Flyball sprt, [visit this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyball)).

The data imitates that the fictional Flyball team's (Wild Runners Flyball Team – or WRFT) coach hired me to analyze their last year's dataset from different races. The overall goal is to find insights that will help to improve their performace.

The analysis was originally made for the in-house competition of the [Data36.com](https://data36.com) data science club, where I ranked at first place with this EDA.

## 2) Project Objective and Results

### *Objective*

**Processing** the WRFT flyball team's competition data from the past year **to build up a comprehensive picture**, which will also help them **to achieve even higher levels of performance** in the future.

*Main contributions:*

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Basic EDA
- Advanced EDA (with collecting data from external sources)
- Team composition optimization

*Dataset:* 
- Table 1: results of the Czech national competition related to the WRFT team
- Table 2: results of the Czech international competition related to the WRFT team
- Table 3: base data of the racing dogs

The description of the dataset variables is available [here](https://github.com/rolandnagy-ds/flyball_race_analysis/tree/main/data).

### *Results*

In the analysis, I have **identified and communicated the key factors** that are critical to race results. I communicated the **recommendations for changes** that would help the team achieve better results and continue to operate.

- Database cleaning and exploratory analysis
- Obtaining missing data from external sources (API)
- Identification of the key factors that determine race results and dog performance
- Recommendations for training plan and competitions to achieve better placings, thus ensuring the sustainability of the team
- Optimisation of team composition
- Presentation of results to stakeholders


 **Methods Used**
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploration
* Investigate Statistical Metrics
* Data Visualization
* Feature Importance analysis with Machine learning
* Optimization with Machine learning
* API usage
* Presentation of found insights

**Tools**
* Python
* Excel
